". When playing, the KEY_(R orL )"
"is disabled. The players must   "
"have the same B_A_Swap setting. "

"the mapper info of the rom. If  "

"Roms bigger than 3.0MB would not"
"be supported. There's not enough"
"memory for it. Take care.       "
"Not all the roms using the      "
"supported mappers works well.   "
"There are a lot of reasons that "
"I cannt figure out yet. You can "

"Render:                         "
"There are 3 methods. The first  "
"one 'Per-Frame' works fine on a "
"lot of games, the second one    "
"'SP-pertile' works great if the "
"game would change the sprites   "
"mid-frame, the third one is a   "
"pure-soft rendering, which is   "
"used when the others work bad.  "
"Second one is recommended.      "
"The thid one will slow down the "
"game, so a 'frameskip' is used. "
"You cannot define it yet.       ",

"VideoMode/PAL/NTSC/FPS:         "
"If you feel the game plays fater"
"than what you thought, you can  "
"try the 'PAL' under the 'File'  "
"bar, which is lead by a         "
"'VideoMode'.                    "

"Only one flashcard for two DS?  "
"    Yeah, this is OK~! Load the "
"nesDS on one DS, then load the  "
"rom file to start play. When    "
"done, you can remove the        "
"flashcard and insert it into    "
"the other one. Nice, ha?        "
"    This could be useful if you "
"guys dont have the same nes rom "
"and want to use the Nifi.       ",

"Frame-Skip for Pure-Soft:       "
"Framskip 2 is recommended, if   "
"you have a DS/DSL. 1 is better  "
"if you have a DSi.              "
"Framskip 1 for DS would be OK,  "
"because 0x38(56) fps is JUST OK.",

"Palette sync:                   "
"Some games may change the       "
"palette mid-frame and this will "
"make the Hareware-Rendering get "
"the wrong color. If one game did"
